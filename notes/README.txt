fake_products:	The original implementation, based on a data feed which
		provided information about a fake product line. This
		version was done on request by Walmart for an engineering
		position I had applied for. Eventually, the API key timed out.

real_products:	A modified version of the original implementation which works
		with a data feed which provides information about Walmart's
		real products.
