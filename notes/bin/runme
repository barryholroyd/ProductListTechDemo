# Download the complete set of demo Walmart Products.
#
# Assume there are 224 total products, since that is
# the current number reported with each download.
#
# There is a maximum of 30 products per download and
# each download contains meta-information (in addition
# to the list of products), such as "totalProducts"
# and "pageNumber", so each download is kept in a
# separate file (named after the page number).
#
# We attempt to download 8*30=240 products. The
# first 7 pages of 30 products downloads 210 products.
# The last page should download the remaiing 14
# products, but instead appears to download a full
# 30 products. This appears to be a bug in the server.
#
# Downloading 224 products one at a time appears to work
# (downloading the 225th product yields an empty list).
#
# In addition, it appears that there are actually only
# 37 unique product ids.
