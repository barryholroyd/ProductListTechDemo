    <h1>Description</h1>
    High performance demo for listing products from Walmart.
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    This app demonstrates techniques for downloading and displaying a list of
    items containing images from the web while maintaining a smooth scrolling
    experience for the user.
    <p>
    The app specifically is <i>not</i> intended to be a full, consumer-ready
    app.  Although its functionality could be easily extended, it current
    only downloads and displays products from Walmart's <i>Electronics</i>
    category.
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    The primary challenge is handling the delayed loading of images. It takes
    too long to download images when the user is scrolling through the list,
    so they have to be downloaded in the background and displayed upon
    arrival. During the delay, RecyclerView may have reallocated the
    ViewHolder for a given image, resulting in the image being displayed for
    the wrong product. The app manages this issue by checking to see if the
    image URL has changed since the original request and does not display the
    image if it is out-of-date.
    <p>
    Images are pre-loaded during the initial scoll to minimize the impact on
    the user.  In addition, all images are retained in memory and/or disk
    caches so that this becomes a non-issue after the initial scroll.
    <p>
    Summary of performance mechanisms:
    <ul>
        <li> Images downloaded in the background. Two implementations are
	     provided: AsnycTask-based and threads-based.
        <li> Initial image url retained as a field and compared to the
	     (potentially updated) URL of the ViewHolder upon image arrival.
        <li> Configurable look-ahead pre-loading.
        <li> Configurable memory cache.
        <li> Configurable disk cache.
    </ul>
    <p>
    The <a href="Walmart Open API">https://developer.walmartlabs.com/</a> is
    used to download product information. This app accesses the paginated
    products portion of that API. 100 products are returned in each batch and
    each batch contains the URL for the next batch.
    <p>
    There are two separate implementations for downloading images in the
    background: Threads-based and AsyncTask-based. The two are equivalent --
    they are both provided only for demonstration purposes.
    <h2>Logging</h2>
    Extensive logging is provided, configurable via the app's run time
    settings.  Watching the log output can be very instructive, especially
    with respect to the caching and networking subsystems. Set the log level
    to verbose and filter on both the package name and "TRACE". The following
    tracing flags can all be set, along with many other parameters.
    <ul>
      <li>AP_TRACE (app-level)
      <li>IL_TRACE (app-level)
      <li>DC_TRACE (disk cache)
      <li>MC_TRACE (memory cache)
      <li>NM_TRACE (network)
      <li>TRACE_DETAILS (more detailed tracing)
    </ul>
