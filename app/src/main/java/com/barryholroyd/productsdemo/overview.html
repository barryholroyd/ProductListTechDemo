    ProductsDemo is a high-performance demo app which lists a sample of
    products from the cloud.
    <p>
        The data is sample data provided by Walmart -- it does not reflect real products.
        It is only provided for demonstration purposes.
    <p>
        The app is provided for demonstration purposes only -- the products
        listed are not real products and are not intended to reflect actual
        products from Walmart. All product information is downloaded as JSON data
        from a demo server.
    <p>
        The app is written to provide smooth scrolling and optimize memory and
        disk usage.
    <ul>
      <li>Pre-fetching of product descriptions in batches, on demand.
      <li>Images downloaded separately, in the background.
      <li>Images scaled down to thumbnail size, if/as necessary.
      <li>Configurable memory cache.
      <li>Configurable disk cache.
    </ul>
    There are two separate implementations for downloading images in the
    background: Threads-based and AsyncTask-based. The two are equivalent --
    they are both provided only for demonstration purposes.
    <p> 
        There is a well-known issue wherein images downloaded in the background
        may arrive too late to be used for their product list entries because the
        relevant product entry is no longer valid -- specifically, in this
        implementation, the RecyclerView ViewHolder may have been recycled by the
        time the image arrives. This implementation recognizes and deals with
        that situation in both the Threads and AsyncTask approaches.
    <p>
        Watching the log output can be very instructive, especially with respect
	to the caching and networking subsystems. The following tracing flags
	can all be set, along with many other parameters, in
        {@link com.barryholroyd.walmartproducts.Configure}.
	<ul>
          <li>APP_TRACE     (app-level)
          <li>DC_TRACE      (disk cache)
          <li>MC_TRACE      (memory cache)
          <li>NM_TRACE      (network)
          <li>TRACE_DETAILS (more detailed tracing)
	</ul>
